This is ScraperFC, a Python package that I hope will give more people access to soccer data. Gone are the days of downloading spreadsheets one-by-one, copy-pasting, or entering data into spreadsheets by hand. I try to make ScraperFC as easy-to-use as possible so that anybody with a bit of Python experience can use it.

To install ScraperFC, run ```pip install ScraperFC``` from the command line.

Data can be scraped from the following sources:
* [FBRef](https://fbref.com/en/)
* [Understat](https://understat.com/)
* [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-predictions/)
* [ClubELO](http://clubelo.com/)
* [Capology](https://www.capology.com/)
* [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.us/)

For documentation, head over to the [Read the Docs page](https://scraperfc.readthedocs.io).

For usage examples, look at Examples.ipynb in the top level directory or some of my example analyses in the analytics_examples folder.
