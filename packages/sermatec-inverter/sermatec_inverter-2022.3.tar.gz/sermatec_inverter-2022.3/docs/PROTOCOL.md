# Protocol description
This protocol is used by the *Sermatec* application (available for Android and iOS) for a local connection to the inverter via built-in WiFi access point or via LAN connection.

Default AP's password is `gsstes123456`.

Distributor's (admin) passwords for setting parameters:
- This password is probably hardcoded in the apk, cannot be changed.
- Discovered passwords:
    - Sermatec2021
    - sermatec2021
    - Sermatec2015
    - Sermatec2019@Gsstes2019

Integers are presented in the big-endian format (MSB first).

Inverter's open ports:
- 23: telnet
- 80: UART-TCP module web config
    - username: admin
    - password: admin
- 8000: ?
- 8899: API port

## Request format
| Byte | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| 0    | `0xFE`  |
| 1    | `0x55`  |
| 2    | source (`0x64`) |
| 3    | target (`0x14`) |
| 4-5  | command |
| 6    | message length |
| 7-n  | data |
| n+1  | checksum |
| n+2  | `0xAE` |

## Response format
It is the same but the source and target addresses are swapped.
Notes: 
- integers are represented in the big-endian format.
- fractional numbers (with exceptions) are represented in the fixed-point, scaling 1/10.
- all values are represented in the SI units (ampere, volt, watt, volt-ampere, volt-ampere reactive, hertz...).
- data type uint16_t at address 0x00 means hi-lo integer stored at bytes 0-1.
