## License

Kybra is licensed under the MIT license found in the LICENSE file. The copyright is intended to be assigned to the holders of the KYBRA token found at canister id [NOT_YET_DEPLOYED] on the Internet Computer. Full copyright assignment may require written and signed agreements which have not yet been implemented.

The KYBRA token code and supply is currently controlled entirely by Jordan Last (lastmjs). The tentative plan is to decentralize the KYBRA ownership, the KYBRA canister, and the Kybra repository over time. The repository for the KYBRA token can be found here: [NOT_YET_CREATED]
