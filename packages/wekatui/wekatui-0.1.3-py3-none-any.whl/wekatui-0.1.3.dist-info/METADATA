This library provides a framework for developing console applications using Python and curses.
Most of the code was shamelessly stolen from npyscreen (https://github.com/npcole/npyscreen), which appears to be a dead project, as the author (Nicholas Cole) has been unresponsive and has not made any changes in years.
However, the base code was useful for our purposes, and will retain the copyright info in the files.
