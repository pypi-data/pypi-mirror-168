    PreferenceSectionWidget

    Interface for Preference Sections.

    To implement correct OK/Cancel:

    * save() must store all changed settings.
    * update_data() should load all values from settings.

    When using settings widgets, the easiest way is to return them
    in via _settings_widgets and use default save and update_data
    implementations.

    For custom behavior, override these two and call save(), update_data()
    from this class to handle save and update of settings widgets, and
    then handle other save and updates manually.
