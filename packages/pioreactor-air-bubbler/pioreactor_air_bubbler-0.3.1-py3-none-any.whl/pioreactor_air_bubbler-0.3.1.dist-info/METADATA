### Pioreactor air bubbler


Add an air-pump / bubbler to your [Pioreactor](https://pioreactor.com). This pump can run continuously, or if OD reading is running, will stop during a reading.

### Usage
```
pio run air_bubbler
```


### Installation

#### Software

From the command line, run:

```
pio install-plugin pioreactor_air_bubbler
```


(Optional) Edit the following to your `config.ini`

```
[PWM]
<the PWM channel you pick>=air_bubbler


[air_bubbler]
duty_cycle=10
hertz=200
pre_delay_duration=1.5
post_delay_duration=0.75
enable_dodging_od=1
```

#### Hardware

Connect the PWM channel to the air pump's leads. Connect a 3mm ID tube between the air pump and a luer lock on the vial's cap.
