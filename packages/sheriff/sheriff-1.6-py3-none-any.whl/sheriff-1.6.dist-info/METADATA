## What is it?

Road accidents, A very common problem, but still nobody is using Al technology to solve it,
so I decided to make a program to solve it, Sheriff - An Al enabled program to detect car speed and to prevent road accidents, 
it will detect which car is overspeeding the speed limit and we can fine some charge to the driver, 
if the car is overspeeding, with Sheriff we can check which car was in overspeed or underspeed by checking the report.log file generated by the program, 
and it will also save the images of cars which were in overspeed, in a folder, to detect the speed, 
you have to select the video file and then it will start doing the process.

## Main Features

Here are just a few of the things that Sheriff does well:

 - Detect car speed using **speed=distance/time** formula.
 - You can detect car speed from any video file.
 - UI made with [PyQt5](https://www.qt.io/).

 ` We know these features are not enough to make a change, but we are trying to improve Sheriff, and hopefully we will reach our goal soon`

## Where to get it?

The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:
https://github.com/Programming-Hero-1313/Sheriff

## Package

#### Links
 - [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/sheriff/0.1/)
 - [Source code](https://github.com/Programming-Hero-1313/Sheriff)

#### Package Installation
    pip install sheriff

#### Package Features
 - Check version
 - Run the GUI
```
from sheriff import *
import sheriff

# Check Sheriff version -
print(sheriff.version())

# Run the GUI -
gui.run()
```

### What's new in v1.6

 - Fixed Issue [#3](https://github.com/Programming-Hero-1313/Sheriff/issues/3)
 - Dependencies, `dlib` and `cmake` removed from `install_requires` attribute in `setup.py`. Now the user have to manually install he dlib module, for that the user have to install `cmake gui` from [here](https://cmake.org/download/) and `cmake library` from [here](https://pypi.org/project/cmake/) or run `pip install cmake` in Powershell. and the user have to install dlib module by running `pip install dlib` in Powershell.

### What's new in v1.5

 - Added change notes in package/README.md
 - Added LICENSE.txt & README.md in MANIFEST.in 

### What's new in v1.4

 - **Bug Fixed** : Dependencies not installing.

### What's new in v1.3

 - Changed `gui_data` directory name to `.gui_data`, so that it will be hidden when you run the `ls` or `list` command in package.
 - Bug Fixed - Window icon not showing on open-cv feed window in package.

### What's new in v1.2

 - Fixed error - 
   ```
   Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\python\lib\site-packages\sheriff\gui.py", line 147, in browsefiles trackMultipleObjects() File "C:\python\lib\site-packages\sheriff\gui.py", line 233, in __init__ root.iconbitmap("gui_data/res/logo.ico") File "C:\python\lib\tkinter\__init__.py", line 2109, in wm_iconbitmap return self.tk.call('wm', 'iconbitmap', self._w, bitmap) _tkinter.TclError: bitmap "gui_data/res/logo.ico" not defined
   ```
 - Bug Fixed - Images not showing on home screen like icon, logo.

## Dependencies

- [OpenCV - OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision](https://opencv.org/)
- [NumPy - Adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays, matrices and high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays](https://www.numpy.org)
- [PyQt5 - Qt is the fastest and smartest way to produce industry-leading software that users love](https://www.qt.io/)

[Video Tutorial for Sheriff Usage](https://streamable.com/29yprj)

**Enter the speed Limit**
- Enter the *Speed Limit* in the input box you want to set

**Click On Start Button**
 - Click on *Start* Button and select the video file

    Now Sheriff should Start detecting car speed from the provided video
    Do the following steps when the detection is complete
    If you are facing any errors feel free to contact me.

**Navigate to overspeeding directory**
 - Navigate to *Overspeeding* directory to see the report

**Navigate to overspeeding/cars directory**
 - Navigate to cars directory located in overspeeding directory to see the *images of cars* which were overspeeding
