# BigCommerce CLI

`bcli` is BigCommerce store management on the command line. It brings the most commonly used store management tools to
the terminal for quick actions and multi-storefront workflows. `bcli` was written to help tech savvy store managers save
time by ditching BigCommerce's browser based admin UI.

# Installation

[`bcli` is available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/bigcommerce-cli/). Use the command `pip install bigcommerce-cli`
for easy installation.

# Getting Started

Use the `bcli settings add-store` command to save a store for `bcli` to use later. Then, use
the `bcli settings active-store` command to select which saved store should be used for your management commands.

Once `bcli` has an active store, you can make DELETE, GET, POST, and PUT commands to manage resources on that store.
