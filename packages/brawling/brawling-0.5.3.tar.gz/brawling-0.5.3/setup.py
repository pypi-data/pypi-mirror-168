It\'s your job to handle it.\n\nThe `proxy` argument will use a [3rd party proxy](https://docs.royaleapi.com/#/proxy). Details on setting up are on the linked page. DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible for anything related to the proxy. I am not in any way related to its developers, and it\'s not my fault if your API access gets blocked because of using it.\n\n`force_no_cache` will disable the caching of requests no matter what. This setting is useless if you didn\'t install with `brawling[cache]`, and otherwise is only recommended if you\'re facing issues because of the cache (such as non-up-to-date responses)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis content is not affiliated with, endorsed, sponsored, or specifically approved by Supercell and Supercell is not responsible for it.
