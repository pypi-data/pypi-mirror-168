## Installation

### Old-school Straight Pip

pip install psgdemos

### pip via `python -m pip` the python recommended way

#### If `python` is your command

python -m pip install psgdemos

#### If `python3` is your command

python3 -m pip install psgdemos

## Usage

Open a command window and type:   

`psgdemos`   

This will launch the "Demo Browser", your gateway to over 300 PySimpleGUI Demo Programs.


## Create a Shortcut To This Program

If you're a Windows user, then use the [`psgshortcut` application](https://pypi.org/project/psgshortcut/) to make a shortcut to this program so that you can then put on your desktop or pin to your taskbar (or any  other use that stops the need to type `psgdemos` ever again).

To get `psgshortcut`, like all of the other `psg application` projects, pip install it.  (e.g. `pip install psgshortcut`)



To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open a command window (I promise, it's the last time you'll need to for this program)
2. Type - `where psgdemos`
3. Copy the line that `where psgdemos` gave you into the first input of the shortcut maker program
4. Run psgdemos by typing `psgdemos` in your command window
5. Right click and choose "File Location"
6. Copy the file location results, but change the extension from .py to .ico and paste into the Icon file input of the shortcut maker
7. Click "Create Shortcut"

This will create a shortcut in the same folder as the target file.  You can safely move this shortcut file to any place you want (like to your desktop).  Double-click the shortcut and your program should launch.

The programs installed and the Demo Browser both reside in the PySimpleGUI Repo on GitHub.  The Demo Browser installed via PyPI is slightly different than the Demo Browser found in the PySimpleGUI Repo.  You can tell the difference by looking at the program's icon.  If it has the PySimpleGUI Emoji as the icon, then it's the pip installed `psgdemo` version.  If the icon is a light bulb, then you're running the version from the PySimpleGUI repo.
