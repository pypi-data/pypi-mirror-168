# Contributing

Want to contribute? Email mikekeith52@gmail.com with your ideas. The following is needed:  
- Issues and feature requests using the Issues tab in GitHub.  
- More example notebooks displayed on the [examples](https://scalecast-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) webpage. If you fork the [scalecast-examples](https://github.com/mikekeith52/scalecast-examples) repository and submit a merge request with a good notebook that showcases scalecast, we will host it and give you credit.   
- Requests to add more models to the library.  
- Better unit testing before making distribution updates.
