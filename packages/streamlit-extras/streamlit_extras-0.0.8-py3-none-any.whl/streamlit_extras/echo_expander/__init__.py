    Parameters
    ----------
    code_location : "above" or "below"
        Whether to show the echoed code before or after the results of the
        executed code block.
        Default is "above"
    expander : Boolean
        Whether the code block should occur in an expander.

    label : Text
        If expander is True, then the label for the expander.
        Default is "Show code"

    -------

    >>> with st.echo_expander(code_location="below", expander=True, label="Expand to see the code"):
