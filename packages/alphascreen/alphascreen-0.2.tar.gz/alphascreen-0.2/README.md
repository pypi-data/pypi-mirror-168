### Job setup

```
alphascreen --parse filename [options]
```

**Options**

**```--fragment```** *```length```*

Approximate fragment length. Default is 500.

**```--overlap```** *```length```*

Sequence is extended by this amount on either side of slices. Default is 50.

**```--dimerize```** *```uniprot-id```*

Dimerize this uniprot ID whenever it is found.

**```--consider```** *```uniprot/start/end```*

Uniprot ID and sequence range to consider. Example: "Q86VS8/1/200" only considers amino acids 1-200 for uniprot ID Q86VS8.

**```--alphafold_exec```** *```path-to-colabfold-executable```*

Path to script that runs Colabfold for writing the commands. Default is "colabfold2".

**```--columnA```** *```columnA-name```*

Name of column heading for uniprot IDs for the first set of interactors. Default is "SWISS-PROT Accessions Interactor A".

**```--columnB```** *```columnB-name```*

Name of column heading for uniprot IDs for the second set of interactors. Default is "SWISS-PROT Accessions Interactor B".

### Check runs

```
alphascreen --check
```

Checks how many runs are finished so far.

```
alphascreen --write_unfinished
```

Checks how many runs are finished so far and writes out a new bash script with the remaining Colabfold commands.

### Analyze results

```
alphascreen --show_top threshold
```

Generate summary files for the runs so far. Only iptms above the threshold value provided will be considered (e.g. ```alphascreen --show_top 0.3``` for iptms above 0.3).
