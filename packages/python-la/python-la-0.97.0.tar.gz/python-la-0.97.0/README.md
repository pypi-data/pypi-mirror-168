# python-la : Python linear algebra v=0.97.0
## introduction
The aim of this project is to implement programatically all of the mathematical operations you can in linear algebra, and more so - to implement themt in such a way that it will be written programmatically as close to mathematically as possible

## How to install
```pip install python-la```
## Examples
```python
>> from python_la import Matrix, Span, Vector, PolynomialSimple, LinearMap, RealField, VectorSpace

>> Matrix([[1,2],[3,4]]).gaussian_elimination()
---------
| 1 | 0 |
---------
| 0 | 1 |
---------

>> Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]).characteristic_polynomial
X^3 - 15X^2 - 18X

>> Matrix([[1, 0, 1],[0, 1, 1]]).kernel
[-1, -1, 1]

>> v1, v2 = Vector([3, 4]), Vector([4, 5])
>> Span([v1,v2]).to_orthonormal()
[0.6, 0.8]
[0.8, -0.6]

>> R2 = RealField(2)
>> V = VectorSpace(R2)
>> lm = LinearMap(V, V, lambda vector: Vector([0, vector[0]], R2))
>> x_squared = PolynomialSimple.from_string("x^2")
>> plus_1 = PolynomialSimple.from_string("x+1")
>> v = V.random()
>> P = plus_1(x_squared)
>> P
X^2 + 1
>> P(lm)(v) == v
True
