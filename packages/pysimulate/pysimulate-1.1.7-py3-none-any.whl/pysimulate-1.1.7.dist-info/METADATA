## Purpose

This project provides a framework to build a simulator to test different agents in a simple environment. This allows you to control the inputs/outputs of the system in python and hotswap the 'drivers' to the vehicles.

Use this repo to build your own AI drivers and test them on your own tracks!

## About
This project was built using the pygame and numpy libraries. In order to install these dependencies use: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Extend from the abstract class `Simulation` from `simulation.py` in order to create a custom simulation or simply use the `DefaultSimulation` class.

Same applies to building a custom vehicle from `vehicle.py` or using the `DefaultVehicle` class.
