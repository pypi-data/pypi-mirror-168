This project provides a framework to build a simulator to test different agents in a simple environment. This allows you to control the inputs/outputs of the system in python and hotswap the 'drivers' to the vehicles.

Use this repo to build your own AI drivers and test them on your own tracks!

This project was built using the pygame and numpy libraries. In order to install these dependencies use:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Extend from the abstract class `Simulation` from `simulation.py` in order to create a custom simulation or simply use the `DefaultSimulation` class.

Same applies to building a custom vehicle from `vehicle.py` or using the `DefaultVehicle` class.
