## About
This project was built using the pygame and numpy libraries. In order to install these dependencies use:

```

Extend from the abstract class `Simulation` from `simulation.py` in order to create a custom simulation or simply use the `DefaultSimulation` class.

Same applies to building a custom vehicle from `vehicle.py` or using the `DefaultVehicle` class.
