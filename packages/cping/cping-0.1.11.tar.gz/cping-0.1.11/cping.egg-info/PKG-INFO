### Sparkline on Windows

The sparkline (right part of the screenshot) is simplified on Windows as it doesn't support the required [block characters](https://w.wiki/zKh). If you know of any substitutes, let me know.

### Unprivileged ICMP Sockets

If you're getting a `Permission denied` exception, it is likely that your OS is
too old to have [unprivileged ICMP sockets](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/EnableSysctlPingGroupRange#Detailed_Description) enabled by default. You can enable
this with:

```shell
sudo sh -c 'echo net.ipv4.ping_group_range = 0 2147483647 >> /etc/sysctl.conf'
sudo sysctl -p
```
