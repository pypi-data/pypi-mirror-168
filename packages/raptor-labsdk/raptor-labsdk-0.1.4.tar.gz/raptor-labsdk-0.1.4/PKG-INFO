# Raptor LabSDK

The LabSDK is a utility library that helps you to develop Raptor-compatible features directly from Python.
It's usually used inside your notebook, and allows you to build features without any further installation.

This way, you can build your features in Raptor, and then deploy them to the cloud later on.
