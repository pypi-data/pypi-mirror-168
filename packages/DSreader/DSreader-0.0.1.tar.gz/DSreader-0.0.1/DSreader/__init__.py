"""
DSreader is a python package for reading data from vegetation maps 
organised according to the Digital Standard.

The digital Standard is a dataformat developed in the nineties
by the Dutch National Forestry Service (Staatsbosbeheer). A vegetion
map comprises an ESRI shapefile with polygons and an Microsoft Access 
database with information about the content of the polygons.

Main package classes
--------------------
MapData
    Manage vegetion map data and connect spatial data to non-spatial
    data.

Helper classes
--------------
ListProjects
    Create table of filenames organised by project under a given root file
MapElements
    Manage spatial data for map elements.
MapTables
    Manage tables with non-spatial data related to mapped elements.
ReadMdb
    Read Microsoft Access .mdb file and extract tables as pd.DataFrame.
ReadShapeFile
    Read ESRI Shapefile and correct errors if necessary.

Classes for spatial analysis
----------------------------
SampleShape
    Create regular grid and sample polygon map at grid points.
SankeyTwoMaps
    Plot Sankey diagram comparing changes in management quality between 
    two maps.
