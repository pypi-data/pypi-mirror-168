calculate z score for weight vs length/height and both wfl and wfh works same

.. code-block:: python

    from cgmzscore.src.main import z_score_wfh

    score = z_score_wfh(weight=["7.853"],age_in_days=['16'],sex=['M'],height=['73'])

calculate z score for length vs age

.. code-block:: python

    from cgmzscore.src.main import z_score_lhfa

    score = z_score_lhfa(age_in_days='16'],sex=['M'],height=['73'])

find child is SAM/MAM/Healthy
