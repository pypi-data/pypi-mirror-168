<!-- News and Updates -->

## News and Updates

- [09/17/2022] The USB paper has been accepted by NeurIPS 2022 Dataset and Benchmark Track! [[Openreview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=QeuwINa96C)]

- [09/02/2022] We are working on optimizing codes. We will share the logs and model checkpoints as we did in TorchSSL.

- [08/21/2022] USB has been released!

<!-- Introduction -->

## Introduction

**USB** is a Pytorch-based Python package for Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL). It is easy-to-use/extend, *affordable* to small groups, and comprehensive for developing and evaluating SSL algorithms. USB provides the implementation of 14 SSL algorithms based on Consistency Regularization, and 15 tasks for evaluation from CV, NLP, and Audio domain.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is an example of how to set up USB locally.
To get a local copy up, running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

USB is built on pytorch, with torchvision, torchaudio, and transformers.

To install the required packages, you can create a conda environment:

```sh
conda create --name usb python=3.8
```

then use pip to install required packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

We provide a Python package *semilearn* of USB for users who want to start training/testing the supported SSL algorithms on their data quickly:

```sh
pip install semilearn
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Development

You can also develop your own SSL algorithm and evaluate it by cloning USB:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Semi-supervised-learning.git
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

USB is easy to use and extend. Going through the belowing examples will help you faimiliar with USB for quick use, evaluate an exsiting SSL algorithm on your own dataset, or developing new SSL algorithms.

### Quick Start with USB package

<!-- TODO: add quick start example and refer lighting notebook -->

Please see [Installation](#installation) to install USB first. We provide colab tutorials for:

- [Beginning example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lFygK31jWyTH88ktao6Ow-5nny5-B7v5)
- [Customize datasets](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zbswPm1sM8j0fndUQOeqX2HADdYq-wOw)

### Training

Here is an example to train FixMatch on CIFAR-100 with 200 labels. Trianing other supported algorithms (on other datasets with different label settings) can be specified by a config file:

```sh
python train.py --c config/usb_cv/fixmatch/fixmatch_cifar100_200_0.yaml
```

### Evaluation

After trianing, you can check the evaluation performance on training logs, or running evaluation script:

```
python eval.py --dataset cifar100 --num_classes 100 --load_path /PATH/TO/CHECKPOINT
```

### Develop

Check the developing documentation for creating your own SSL algorithm!
