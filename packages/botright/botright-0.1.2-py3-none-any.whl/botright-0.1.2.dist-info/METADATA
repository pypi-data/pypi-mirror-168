# Botright v1.0

## Install it from PyPI

```bash
pip install botright
playwright install
```

---

## Usage

### Botright is only available in async mode.
### It is fully plugable with your existing playwright code. You only have to change your browser initialization!

```py
import asyncio

import botright


async def main():
    botright_client = await botright.Botright(headless=False)
    browser = await botright_client.new_browser()
    page = await browser.new_page()

    # Continue by using the Page

    await botright_client.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Artificial Intelligence

The AI of this bot is not mine and i dont take any credits for it.

It was created by QIN2DIM and can be found [here](https://github.com/QIN2DIM/hcaptcha-challenger).

However, i edited out some code/files, to make Botright lightweighter and to use less imports.

Also, i coded a MouseMovement Generator, to get more realistic MotionData. It uses Interpolation between CaptchaImage-Coordinates to do so.
