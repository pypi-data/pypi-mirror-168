           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

# anomatools

`anomatools` is a small Python package containing recent **anomaly detection algorithms**.
Anomaly detection strives to detect _abnormal_ or _anomalous_ data points from a given (large) dataset.
The package contains several state-of-the-art semi-supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms.

## Installation

Install the package directly from PyPi with the following command:

```bash
pip install anomatools
```

OR install the package using the `setup.py` file:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

OR install it directly from GitHub itself:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Vincent-Vercruyssen/anomatools.git@master
```

## Contents and usage

### Semi-supervised anomaly detection

Given a dataset with attributes **X** and labels _Y_, indicating whether a data point is _normal_ or _anomalous_, semi-supervised anomaly detection algorithms are trained using all the instances **X** and some of the labels _Y_.
Semi-supervised approaches to anomaly detection generally outperform the unsupervised approaches, because they can use the label information to correct the assumptions on which the unsupervised detection process is based.
The `anomatools` package implements two recent semi-supervised anomaly detection algorithms:

1. The **SSDO** (_semi-supervised detection of outliers_) algorithm first computes an unsupervised prior anomaly score and then corrects this score with the known label information [1].
2. The **SSkNNO** (_semi-supervised k-nearest neighbor anomaly detection_) algorithm is a combination of the well-known _kNN_ classifier and the _kNNO_ (k-nearest neighbor outlier detection) method [2].

Given a training dataset **X_train** with labels _Y_train_, and a test dataset **X_test**, the algorithms are applied as follows:

```python
from anomatools.models import SSkNNO, SSDO

# train
detector = SSDO()
detector.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# predict
labels = detector.predict(X_test)
```

Similarly, the probability of each point in **X_test** being normal or anomalous can also be computed:

```python
probabilities = detector.predict_proba(X_test, method='squash')
```

Sometimes we are interested in detecting anomalies in the training data (e.g., when we are doing a post-mortem analysis):

```python
# train
detector = SSDO()
detector.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# predict
labels = detector.labels_

```

### Unsupervised anomaly detection:

Unsupervised anomaly detectors do not make use of label information (user feedback) when detecting anomalies in a dataset. Given a dataset with attributes **X** and labels _Y_, the unsupervised detectors are trained using only **X**.
The `anomatools` package implements two recent semi-supervised anomaly detection algorithms:

1. The **kNNO** (_k-nearest neighbor outlier detection_) algorithm computes for each data point the anomaly score as the distance to its k-nearest neighbor in the dataset [[3](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=335437)].
2. The **iNNE** (_isolation nearest neighbor ensembles_) algorithm computes for each data point the anomaly score roughly based on how isolation the point is from the rest of the data [[4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/coin.12156)].

Given a training dataset **X_train** with labels _Y_train_, and a test dataset **X_test**, the algorithms are applied as follows:

```python
from anomatools.models import kNNO, iNNE

# train
detector = kNNO()
detector.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# predict
labels = detector.predict(X_test)
```

## Package structure
