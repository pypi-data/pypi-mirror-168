# Introduction
microkinetic_toolkit is made to perform the microkinetic simulation
based on the ab initio calculation such as density functional theory (DFT).

These codes do
* evaluation of reaction energy, reaction Gibbs energy etc. from elementary reaction string
* evaluation of reaction rate constants from above quantities
* solving the rate equation (microkinetic analysis)
* visualization of the chemica reaction network

## Input
File with elementary reactions: json, csv.

## Output
Change of the molar fraction is shown on the screen

## Authors
* Atsushi Ishikawa (National Institute for Materials Science)
* Haruyuki Oda (Hitachi, Ltd.)
