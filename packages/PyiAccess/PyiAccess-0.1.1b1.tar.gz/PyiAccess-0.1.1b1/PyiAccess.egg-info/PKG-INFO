Description: # Systems i Access client for python
        It is a client library for access to IBM System i with ODBC and SSH.
        
        Features
        [x] Support for Python 3.
        
        # Installation of dependencies
        Before installing pyodbc you must install the packages from Debian/Ubuntu systems.
        
        1.1  INSTALLING ON DEBIAN-BASED LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS.
        
        ```
          sudo apt update
          sudo apt install libpq-dev python-dev python3-dev
          sudo apt install python3.5-dev python3.6-dev
          sudo apt install unixodbc-dev
          sudo apt install build-essential
        ```
        To connect to IBM iSeries systems we will need to download a .deb file, this library can be downloaded from the IBM page https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-i-access-client-solutions. So let's create an account, log in, and download the IBM i Access for Linux package.
        
        Example installation instructions:
        ```
          sudo apt install ./ibm-iaccess-1.1.0.15-1.0.ppc64el.deb
        ```
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install pyiaccess.
        ```python
        pip install pyiaccess
        ```
        
        # Usage
        Create a .env file in the root of your project
        
        ```
        ISERIE_DSN = LIBRARY
        ISERIE_HOST = HOST
        ISERIE_USER = USER
        ISERIE_PASSWORD = PASSWORD
        
        SFTP_PORT = 22
        SFTP_REMOTE_PATH = "/home/repo/"
        ```
        
        Configuration of environment variables of the project or application
        
        ```python
        import os
        from pyiaccess.manage import set_env
        
        # Define .env file with absolute or complete path.
        path_env = '/home/user/proyect/.env'
        
        # Define .env file with relative path of the project or application.
        BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
        path_env = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, ".env")
        
        # Load the environment variables.
        set_env(path_env)
        ```
