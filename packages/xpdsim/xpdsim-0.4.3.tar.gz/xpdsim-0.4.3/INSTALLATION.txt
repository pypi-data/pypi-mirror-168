These instructions are for Simon
Steps:

Initial setup
  1. Create a new conda environment as a sandbox, e.g., : `conda create -n xpdsim python=3 ipython`
  2. Clone both repos: xpdAcq and xpdSim. After clone, there should be two separate directories in your computer. Make sure the Master branch is checked out.
  3. Navigate to the top directory of the xpdSim repository.
  4. Activate the `xpdsim` conda environment e.g., `source activate xpdsim` (linux) or `activate xpdsim` (windows)
  5. run `python setup.py develop`
  6. repeat for xpdAcq
  7. Add ophyd
      1. Install real ophyd: `git clone https://github.com/NSLS-II/ophyd.git`
      2. Navigate to `ophyd` repo, do `python setup.py develop`
      3. Install supporting packages `pip install pyepics prettytable`
  4. Copy and paste the `profile_xpdsim` directory from xpdSim to your `~/.ipython` directory

This should have installed all the components.
To run a simulation
  1. activate the simulation environment.
  2. cd to a directory where you want to work.
  3. start ipython: `ipython --profile=xpdsim`
  4. Now you are ready to run simulations: follow the directions on the xpdAcq
    document pages under the `XPD users` link.
  5. [fixme] new beamtime vs. go again.
  7. There is no Beamline scientist to set up your Beamtime `bt` object so set
