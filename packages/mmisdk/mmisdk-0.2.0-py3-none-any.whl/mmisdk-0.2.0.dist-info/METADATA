## Usage

Use this SDK to programmatically create Ethereum transactions, and submit them to custodians connected with MetaMask Institutional. Automate trading strategies on your wallets under custody, and still benefit from the institutional-grade security of your favorite qualified custodian and custody provider.

### Getting started

```bash
pip3 install mmisdk
```

```python
from mmisdk import CustodianFactory

factory = CustodianFactory()

custodian = factory.create_for("qredo", "YOUR-REFRESH-TOKEN")

transaction = custodian.create_transaction(qredo_tx_details, tx_params)
custodian.get_transaction(transaction.id)
```

For a complete documentation on how to use the library, visit the page [MetaMask Institutional SDK](https://consensys.gitlab.io/codefi/products/mmi/mmi-sdk-py/sdk-python/), or check the [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/ConsenSys/codefi/products/mmi/mmi-sdk-py/-/blob/main/docs/mkdocs/sdk-python.md). You can also explore various usage examples in the directory [`./examples`](https://gitlab.com/ConsenSys/codefi/products/mmi/mmi-sdk-py/-/tree/main/examples).

### Supported custodians

| Custodian  | Supported | As of version | Factory name param |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Qredo      | ✅        | 0.2.0         | `"qredo"`          |
| Qredo Dev  | ✅        | 0.1.0         | `"qredo-dev"`      |
| Cactus     | ✅        | 0.2.0         | `"cactus"`         |
| Cactus Dev | ✅        | 0.2.0         | `"cactus-dev"`     |
| All others | ❌        |               |                    |

## Developer documentation

The commands we list below use `python` and `pip`. Depending on your local setup, you might need to replace them by `python3` and `pip3`.

### Requirements

-   Python 3.7 or above

### Installing dependencies

To install `mmisdk`, along with the tools you need to develop and run tests, run the following:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Unit tests

Run all unit tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

### End to end tests

A good way to test the library is also to run the various examples scripts. First, in all [examples](./examples/) files, replace the placeholders `YOUR-REFRESH-TOKEN-XXX` by real values. Then run:

```bash
cd example
pytest
```

### Releasing automatically

To release a new version, follow these steps:

1. Make sur you're on branch `main`
2. This template provides a basic [bumpversion](https://pypi.org/project/bump2version) configuration. To bump the version, run:

    - `bumpversion patch` to increase version from `1.0.0` to `1.0.1`.
    - `bumpversion minor` to increase version from `1.0.0` to `1.1.0`.
    - `bumpversion major` to increase version from `1.0.0` to `2.0.0`.

    Use [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/) standard to bump versions.

3. Push the changes and the tags:

    ```bash
    git push --tags
    ```

### Releasing manually

#### Building

Before building dists make sure you got a clean build area:

```bash
rm -rf build
rm -rf src/*.egg-info
```

Note:

> Dirty `build` or `egg-info` dirs can cause problems: missing or stale files in the resulting dist or strange and confusing errors. Avoid having them around.

Then you should check that you got no packaging issues:

```bash
tox -e check
```

When checking with `tox -e check`, you might receive warnings from `isort` that imports are not properly ordered. To automatically sort your imports with `isort`, run the following:

```bash
pip install isort
isort .
```

To run a complete QA analysis, including unit tests again multiple Python versions, manifest check, and imports order check, run:

```bash
tox
```

And then you can build the `sdist`, and if possible, the `bdist_wheel` too:

```bash
python setup.py clean --all sdist bdist_wheel
```

#### Publishing to PyPI

To make a release of the project on PyPI, assuming you got some distributions in `dist/`, the most simple usage is:

```bash
twine upload --skip-existing dist/*.whl dist/*.gz dist/*.zip
```

In ZSH you can use this to upload everything in `dist/` that ain't a linux-specific wheel (you may need `setopt extended_glob`):

```bash
twine upload --skip-existing dist/*.(whl|gz|zip)~dist/*linux*.whl
```
