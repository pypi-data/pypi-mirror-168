# Sequence-mining

## Description

This package implements SPAM algorithm described in the paper 
[**Sequential PAttern Mining using A Bitmap Representation**](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/johannes/papers/2002/kdd2002-spam.pdf) by 
Jay Ayres, Johannes Gehrke, Tomi Yiu, and Jason Flannick.

This package mostly translates a SPAM implementation written in Java by **Philippe Fournier-Viger**, which can be found 
in the next repository [**spmf**](https://github.com/pommedeterresautee/spmf). For more information about **spmf** implementation,
please, read the Web page [**Mining Frequent Sequential Patterns Using The CM-SPAM Algorithm**](https://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/CM-SPAM.php)

This package does not use files as input and output formats. It uses list of lists.
