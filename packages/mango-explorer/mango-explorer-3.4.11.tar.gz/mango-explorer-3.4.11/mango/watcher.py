# # ðŸ¥­ TWatched generic type

TWatched = typing.TypeVar("TWatched", covariant=True)


# # ðŸ¥­ Watcher protocol
#
# The `Watcher` protocol just says the object has a property `latest` of type `TWatched`.
#
# The idea behind this is that we can have an object that's subscribed to a websocket and updates, say,
# the Group. But instead of having to explicitly reference websocket implementation details or force
# a common base class on all watchers, we can use the protocol to have any object be a `Watcher` as long
# as it provides a `latest` property of the appropriate type.
#

        raise NotImplementedError("Watcher.latest is not implemented on the Protocol.")


# # ðŸ¥­ ManualUpdateWatcher class
#
# The `ManualUpdateWatcher` class provides a basic implementation of the `Watcher` protocol that
# requires manual intervention (updating of the `value` member) to set the latest version.

# # ðŸ¥­ LamdaUpdateWatcher class
#
# The `LamdaUpdateWatcher` class provides a basic implementation of the `Watcher` protocol that
# calls a lambda to determine the latest version.
