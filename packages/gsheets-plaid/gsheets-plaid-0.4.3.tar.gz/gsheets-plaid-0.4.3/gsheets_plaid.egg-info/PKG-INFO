# GSheets-Plaid
A spring break project to get my bank transaction data in Google Sheets without using Google Apps Script.

`gsheets-plaid` is a tool for getting your raw bank transaction data into a Google Sheets spreadsheet, to enable you to make your own formulas and charts for tracking spending, making goals, etc. This app is 100% free (assuming you don't already have a bunch of Google Cloud projects), but there is a bit of one-time setting up to do to get your Google and Plaid credentials in place.

The [`TUTORIAL`](TUTORIAL.md) contains all the instructions to get you from a fresh install of the package to bank transactions in a Google Sheets file.

Please open an issue if something isn't working or if the documentation isn't clear.
