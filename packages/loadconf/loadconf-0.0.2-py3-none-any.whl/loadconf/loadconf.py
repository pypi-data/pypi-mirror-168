        Things to note:

            - read_conf() will make effort to determine int and bool values
              for settings instead of storing everything as a string.
            - If the user has a value that has an unescaped delimiter then csv.Error will
              get raised with a note about the line number that caused the error.
            - The default delimiter is the equal sign "=" but you can set something
              different
            - The default comment character is pound "#" but you can set it to something
              different
            - For users to escape the delimiter character they can use a backslash. That
              backslash will not get included in the stored value.

        The purpose of this method is to allow you to store each line of a file in a
        list accessible through c.stored["key"]. Why might you want this? Instead of
        forcing a brittle syntax on the user you can give them an entire file to work
        with. If a variable is useful as a list then this gives users an easy way to
        define that list.

        keys that correspond to a defined file. If you haven't defined any files then
