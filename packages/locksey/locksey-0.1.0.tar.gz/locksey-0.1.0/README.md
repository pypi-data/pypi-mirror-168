# ðŸ”’ locksey ðŸ”’

Personal CLI utility tool to easily encrypt and decrypt files in a directory. Can be used to 
encrypt secrets in a repo, MFA recovery codes, password text files, your journal/diary entries or any text file with personal or confidential information.

## How does it work?

- If you want a file in a directory to work with locksey, you name the file with ending with `.unlocked.*` extension.
When you run `locksey lock <password>`, it will recursively find all `.unlocked.*` files, encrypt them and rename them to `.locked.*`.

- Similarly when you run `locksey unlock <password>`, it will recursively find all `.locked.*` files, decrypt them and rename them to `.unlocked.*`.

- You can also tell locksey to store the password in you home folder so you don't have to type it again.

- Files are encrypted as described in [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55147077/5516481) stackoverflow post.
