# Template for building a Python package

This package provides a basic template for a Python package with nested directories. If using PyCharm, there's no need to activate the virtual environment (https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html). To ensure the directories are found, mark all directories as "Sources Root" (right click > Mark Directory As...). 


For starters, upgrade the following packages:

> py -m pip install --upgrade pip

> python -m pip install --upgrade pip-tools

1. Use pipreqs to make a requirements.txt file based on all packages in environment
> pipreqs template_KCEvers

To overwrite existing requirements.txt file:
> pipreqs --force 

or use piptools to make a requirements.txt file based on dependencies specified in setup.py/setup.cfg/pyproject.toml (https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools)
> python -m pip install pip-tools

> pip-compile -o requirements.txt pyproject.toml

To update, run:
> pip-compile --output-file=requirements.txt pyproject.toml

However, this does not make sure that required packages are installed. Users would have to manually run:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

To specify which packages (and which versions) should be installed when installing the template_KCEvers package, packages need to be specified in the setup.cfg file under install_requires, e.g. 

    install_requires =
        numpy==1.21.6
        pathlib==1.0.1

or in the pyproject.toml file under dependencies, e.g. 

    dependencies = [
        "numpy==1.21.6", 
        "pathlib==1.0.1"
        ]
(I haven't found a way of automatically generating a setup.cfg/pyproject.toml file with the required packages, so for now copy + paste from the requirements.txt file).

2. Install the package in editable mode 
> cd template_KCEvers

> pip install -e . # or equivalently, --editable rather than -e

3. Publish on PyPi
For full instructions, follow https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/.

- Build source distribution and wheel (better than running "python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel"):
> py -m pip install --upgrade build

> python -m build

- Before trying to upload your distribution, you should check to see if your brief / long descriptions provided in setup.py are valid. You can do this by running twine check on your package files:
> py -m pip install --upgrade twine

> twine check dist/*

- It's also highly recommended to first upload your package on TestPyPi (https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-your-project-to-pypi). Your user name is __token__, and your API token that you can generate at https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/ is the password (note that your password won't show as you're typing):
> py -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

- Check whether the installation worked
> py -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps template_KCEvers

Note that you may have issues with imported packages (e.g. import numpy) using TestPyPi.

- Upload distribution to PyPi (your user name is still "__token__", check https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/ for your API token)
> twine upload dist/*

The package can now be downloaded from PyPi by running
> pip install template_KCEvers==0.0.1

- To upload the package, simply change the version number in pyproject.toml, delete the *.tar.gz and *.whl files in the dist/ directory, and rerun
> py -m pip install --upgrade build

> py -m pip install --upgrade twine

> twine check dist/*

> py -m build 

> twine upload dist/*

Now you can upgrade the package using
> pip install --upgrade template-KCEvers

Check which version is installed using
> pip list
