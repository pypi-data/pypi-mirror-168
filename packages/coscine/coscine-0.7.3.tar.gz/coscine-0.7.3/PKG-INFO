## Code example

Shown below is a small code snippet highlighting some functionality
offered by this package.  

```python
import coscine

cfg = coscine.Config()
client = coscine.Client(cfg.token)
project = client.project("My Project")
resource = project.resource("My Resource")
resource.upload("file.txt", "C:/databases/file.txt")
for file in resource.objects():
	print(file.name)
	print(file.metadata())
	if file.size > 4096: file.delete()
metadata = resource.object("path/to/file.csv").form()
metadata["Author"] = "John Doe"
resource.object("path/to/file.csv").update(metadata)
project.download("/home/datascience", metadata=True)
```

## Documentation

The source code has been thorougly documented with *Python DOCstrings*.
Documentation can be generated via a variety of tools that take advantage
of these *DOCstrings*, such as [pydoc] or [pdoc3].  
Use the following script to generate documentation with *pdoc3*:  
```bash
cd ./coscine-python-sdk
py -m pip install pdoc3
py -m pdoc --html --force --template-dir src/docs/template -o ./public ./src/coscine
```  
The documentation inside of this repository is automatically deployed to
a [GitLab-Pages instance] for online access.
