	**Fetch history output from** ``.odb`` **file and save to** ``.csv`` **file.**

        If reaction force and displacement at Node 2 of the assembly are requested as history output to ``ExampleJob.odb``, then executing the following:

        .. code-block:: python

            historyOutput({'JobID':'ExampleJob'})

        results in the creation of ``ExampleJob.csv`` with the history output:

            .. tab:: ExampleJob.csv::
