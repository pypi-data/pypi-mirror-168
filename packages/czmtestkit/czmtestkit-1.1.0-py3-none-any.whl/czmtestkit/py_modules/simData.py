def Results(dict):
    """
    **Calculates the effective displacement and reaction force from history output.**

    :Parameters:

        **dict** (`dict`): Input data for the instance in the design of experiments required to execute :func:`Results` functions.

            :Keys: Values

            :'JobID': (`str`) File name of the `.csv` file with history output of reaction force and displacement extracted from the `.odb` file.

            :'Width': (`float`) Since the CAE models are of unit width, the results are adjusted using the actual width as a multiplier.

	
    :return:
        
        **OutputData** (`dict`): History output data.

            :Keys: Values

            :'Reaction Force': (`list`) Magnitude of the reaction force effective over the total specimen width.

            :'Displacement': (`list`) Opening displacement.

            :'NodeSet': (`list`) Name of the node from which the history output was extracted.


    .. dropdown:: Example

        Read reaction force and history output extracted from ``.odb`` file and printed to to ``.csv`` file like the one below. (See :func:`czmtestkit.abaqus_modules.historyOutput` to generate this ``.csv`` file.)
