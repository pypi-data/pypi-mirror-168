        Launches the `main()` function of the version of PySimpleGUI that is found by this program.  It may be a local copy on your hard disk that is found on the PYTHON_PATH.  It may be the pip installed version of PySimpleGUI that the interpreter running `psgpsg` finds.  The purpose of `psgpsg` is to allow you to easily launch the main test harness for any of these situations.
        
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Old-school Straight Pip
        
        `pip install psgpsg`
        
        ### pip via `python -m pip` the python recommended way
        
        #### If `python` is your command
        
        `python -m pip install psgpsg`
        
        #### If `python3` is your command
        
        `python3 -m pip install psgpsg`
        
        ## Usage
        
        Open a command window and type:   
        
        `psgpsg`   
        
        
        ## Create a Shortcut To This Program
        
        If you're a Windows user, then use the [`psgshortcut` application](https://pypi.org/project/psgshortcut/) to make a shortcut to this program so that you can then put on your desktop or pin to your taskbar (or any  other use that stops the need to type `psgpsg` ever again).
        
        To get `psgpsg`, like all of the other `psg application` projects, pip install it.  (e.g. `pip install psgshortcut`)
        
        
        
        To do this, follow these steps:
        
        1. Open a command window (I promise, it's the last time you'll need to for this program)
        2. Type - `where psgpsg`
        3. Copy the line that `where psgpsg` gave you into the first input of the shortcut maker program
        4. Run psgpsg by typing `psgpsg` in your command window
        5. Right click and choose "File Location"
        6. Copy the file location results, but change the extension from .py to .ico and paste into the Icon file input of the shortcut maker
        7. Click "Create Shortcut"
        
        This will create a shortcut in the same folder as the target file.  You can safely move this shortcut file to any place you want (like to your desktop).  Double-click the shortcut and your program should launch.
