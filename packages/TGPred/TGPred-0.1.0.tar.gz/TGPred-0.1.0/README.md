# TGPred v.0.1.0 (Python Version)

<!-- badges: start -->

Python version of TGPred contains six efficient methods for predicting target genes of a transcription factor by integrating statistics, machine learning, and optimization:

- **HuberNet**: Huber loss function along with Network-based penalty function;
- **HuberLasso**: Huber loss function along with Lasso penalty function;
- **HuberENET**: Huber loss function along with Elastic Net penalty function;
- **MSENet**: Mean square error loss function along with Network-based penalty function;
- **MSELasso**: Mean square error loss function along with Lasso penalty function;
- **MSEENET**: Mean square error loss function along with Elastic Net penalty function;
- **APGD**: The Accelerated Proximal Gradient Descent (APGD) algorithm to solve the above six penalized regression models.
