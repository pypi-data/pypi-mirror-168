### A high level testing framework for Disnake bots

Written for my needs, open source for yours.

---

Currently still in extremely early development so don't expect a lot.

### Support

### Funding

This project is built entirely around my current personal & freelance needs, 
therefore it only covers the areas of Disnake I wish to test. If you want
this package to support further areas of Disnake consider 
sponsoring me [here](https://github.com/sponsors/Skelmis)
