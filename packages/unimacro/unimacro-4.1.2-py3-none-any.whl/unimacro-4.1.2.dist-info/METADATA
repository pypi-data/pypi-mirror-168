# Installing

Unimacro is reasonably stable, but still in alpha.  Check the [Unimacro Issues](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/unimacro/issues) to see the problem
areas - probably nothing you can't live without.

You can download can updated pywin32 from https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/pull/1622/checks, click on Artifacts,  download the artifacts, extract the files to your computer somehwhere.

# Location of Grammars

Grammars installed with Unimacro will be installed in:
the Lib\site-packages\unimacro\UnimacroGrammars sub-directory of your 
Python installation.  Good ones to start with include _folders.py and _clickbyvoice.py 
as most users will  find web and file system navigation by voice useful.
