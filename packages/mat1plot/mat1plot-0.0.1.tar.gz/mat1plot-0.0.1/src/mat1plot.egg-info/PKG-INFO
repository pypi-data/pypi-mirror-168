# mat1plot

## Description
This package is a collection of easy-to-use commands for plotting using SymPy. It is designed to fit the requirements of *01005 - Advanced Mathematics in Engineering 1* course at the Technical University of Denmark, found [here](https://01005.compute.dtu.dk/). This includes, but is not limited to:

- Plotting of vector fields
- 2D plotting of SymPy functions
- 3D plotting of SymPy functions

## Installation
To install mat1plot using PyPi, run the following command

``$ pip install mat1plot``

## Usage
Use is designed for the *01005 - Advanced Mathematics in Engineering 1* course at the Technical University of Denmark. Any usecase outside this scope is thus not considered, but very welcome!
