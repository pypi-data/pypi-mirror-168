# Cryptowrench

This is a set of tools that I created to play around with blockchains and cryptocurrencies in general.

Install with:
```
pip -m install cryptowrench
```

Feel free to use it for your own projects.

Although these tools test themselves against publicly available test vectors (which means they should be mostly correct), **please for the love of dinosaurs** do not rely on them for storing your money. Use a proper wallet for that instead (see: [ethereum.org/en/wallets/](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets), for some wallets).

Please create issues/pull requests/feature requests where needed.
