# Cryptowrench

This is a set of tools that I created to learn and play around with blockchains and cryptocurrencies in general.

Install with:
```
pip -m install cryptowrench
```

Feel free to use it for your own projects.

## Disclaimer
Although I try my best to make these tools as correct and reliable as possible, `please for the love of dinosaurs` do not rely on them for storing your money. Use a proper wallet for that instead (see: [ethereum.org/en/wallets/](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets), for some wallets).

That said, this library has been tested against publicly available test vectors (i.e. from [bip32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki#Test_Vectors) and [bip39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki#Test_vectors), among others), which means that it should be mostly correct for those functionalities. Expect more tests to be added in the future, and see [`run_tests.py`](https://github.com/omirete/cryptowrench/blob/master/run_tests.py) if you would like to run these tests yourself.

## Colaborate :)
Please create issues/pull requests/feature requests where needed. I'm also looking to collaborate in other open source projects, so let me know if you would like to talk!
