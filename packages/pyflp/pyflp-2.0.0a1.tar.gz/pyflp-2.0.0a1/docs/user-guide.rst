User Guide
==========

*This document is a WIP, please help me improve it! Having the perspective of
someone completely new to PyFLP or even Python can improve this section.*

Here are some features of PyFLP

Godlevel docstrings
-------------------

PyFLP has been carefully written to take advantage of the features provided
by a modern editor, like VSCode. One area, I particularly devoted a lot of
time to are docstrings.

Since PyFLP's entire documentation is only its reference, I thought it might
be challenging for a first time user to know where to find the data they need.

Visual hints
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make it somewhat easier of a journey, I haved added links to images and GIFs
from FL Studio's interface.

Minimums, maximums and defaults
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A lot of properties also have *suggested* minimum, maximum and default values.
When I say suggested, I mean that FLP is a closed format owned by Image-Line.
Its on their whims what they do with it. The values I suggest are only on a
*last-I-checked-they-were-these* basis. However, my research till now has
shown me that they rarely change.
