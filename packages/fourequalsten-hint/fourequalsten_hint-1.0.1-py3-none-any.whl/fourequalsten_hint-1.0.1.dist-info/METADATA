# 4=10's Solution Generator

***by Cheewy***

## Description : 

This tiny program in Python allows you to quickly and simply calculate every possible solutions to the famous *4=10* game.</br>
I had a lot of fun developping it, I hope you will enjoy it.</br>

Note : The code don't have comments, but if you want some, just send me an email and I will do it.

## DISCLAIMER BEFORE USING IT

*Use this program sparingly, or only when you are **REALLY** stuck and you have no more daily solution left.*</br>
*Using this program too much will ruin your entire game experience, and will be very insulting to the game developpers.*</br>
*I am **NOT** responsible for any bad game experience.*</br>

python3 -m pip install fourequalsten_hint
