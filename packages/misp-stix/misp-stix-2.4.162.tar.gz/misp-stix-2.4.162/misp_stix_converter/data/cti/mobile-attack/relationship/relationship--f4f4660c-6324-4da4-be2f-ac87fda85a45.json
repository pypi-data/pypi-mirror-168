However, this policy only affects notifications generated within the managed profile, not by the rest of the device. The `DevicePolicyManager.setApplicationHidden` method can be used to disable unwanted applications that are accessing notifications, but using this method would block that entire application from running.(Citation: Android Notification Listeners)",
