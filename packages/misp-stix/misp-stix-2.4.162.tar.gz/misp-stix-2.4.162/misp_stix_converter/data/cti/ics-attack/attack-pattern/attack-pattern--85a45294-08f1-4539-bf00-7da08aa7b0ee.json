A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system. (Citation: EAttack Exploitation of Remote Services)\n\nICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit. In each of these cases, self-propagating (\u201cwormable\u201d) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.
