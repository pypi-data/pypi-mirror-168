Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system\u2019s operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary\u2019s operational objectives. In addition, the system\u2019s configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage. Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation. This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware. An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the system\u2019s API.",
