The output is the instructions the PLC sends to a device to change its operating behavior. By intercepting the peripheral output, [Stuxnet](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Software/S0010) prevents an operator from noticing unauthorized commands sent to the peripheral.(Citation: Wired W32.Stuxnet Feb 2011)",
