Many of the targeted organizations have been located in the Middle East including Kuwait. HEXANE's targeting of telecommunications has been speculated to be part of an effort to establish man-in-the-middle capabilities throughout the region. HEXANE's TTPs appear similar to [APT33](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Group/G0003) and [OilRig](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Group/G0010) but due to differences in victims and tools it is tracked as a separate entity.
