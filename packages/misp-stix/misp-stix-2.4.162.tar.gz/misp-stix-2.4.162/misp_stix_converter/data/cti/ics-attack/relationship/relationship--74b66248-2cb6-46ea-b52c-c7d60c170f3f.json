            "description": "[Triton](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Software/S0013) is able to modify code if the Triconex SIS Controller is configured with the physical keyswitch in \u2018program mode\u2019 during operation. If the controller is placed in Run mode (program changes not permitted), arbitrary changes in logic are not possible substantially reducing the likelihood of manipulation. Once the Triton implant is installed on the SIS it is able to conduct any operation regardless of any future position of the keyswitch.(Citation: FireEye TRITON Dec 2017)",
