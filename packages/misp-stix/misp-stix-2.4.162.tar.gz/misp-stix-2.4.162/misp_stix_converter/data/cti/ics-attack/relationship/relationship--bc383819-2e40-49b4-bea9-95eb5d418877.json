            "description": "[Stuxnet](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Software/S0010) uses a thread to monitor a data block DB890 of sequence A or B. This thread is constantly running and probing this block (every 5 minutes). On an infected PLC, if block DB890 is found and contains a special magic value (used by Stuxnet to identify his own block DB890), this block\u2019s data can be read and written. This thread is likely used to optimize the way sequences A and B work, and modify their behavior when the Step7 editor is opened.(Citation: Wired W32.Stuxnet Feb 2011)",
