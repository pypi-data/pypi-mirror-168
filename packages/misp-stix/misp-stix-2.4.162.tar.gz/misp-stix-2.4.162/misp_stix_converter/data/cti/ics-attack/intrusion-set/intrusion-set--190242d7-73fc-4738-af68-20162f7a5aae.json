            "description": "[ALLANITE](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Group/G0009) is a suspected Russian cyber espionage group, that has primarily targeted the electric utility sector within the United States and United Kingdom. The group's tactics and techniques are reportedly similar to [Dragonfly](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Group/G0002) / [Dragonfly 2.0](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Group/G0006), although ALLANITE\u2019s technical capabilities have not exhibited disruptive or destructive abilities. It has been suggested that the group maintains a presence in ICS for the purpose of gaining understanding of processes and to maintain persistence. (Citation: Dragos ALLANITE)",
