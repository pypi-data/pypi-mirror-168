            "description": "DP_RECV is the name of a standard function block used by network coprocessors. It is used to receive network frames on the Profibus \u2013 a standard industrial network bus used for distributed I/O. The original block is copied to FC1869, and then replaced by a malicious block. Each time the function is used to receive a packet, the malicious Stuxnet block takes control: it will call the original DP_RECV in FC1869 and then perform postprocessing on the packet data. The replaced DP_RECV block (later on referred to as the \u201cDP_RECV monitor\u201d) is meant to monitor data sent by the frequency converter drives to the 315-2 CPU via CP 342-5 Profibus communication modules.(Citation: Wired W32.Stuxnet Feb 2011)",
