Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to disable or circumvent security features.\n\nAdversaries may have prior knowledge through <span class=\"smw-format list-format \"><span class=\"smw-row\"><span class=\"smw-field\"><span class=\"smw-value\">Control Device Identification</span></span></span></span> about security features implemented on control devices. These device security features will likely be targeted directly for exploitation. There are examples of firmware RAM/ROM consistency checks on control devices being targeted by adversaries to enable the installation of malicious System Firmware",
