            "description": "Provide operators with redundant, out-of-band communication to support monitoring and control of the operational processes, especially when recovering from a network outage. Out-of-band communication should utilize diverse systems and technologies to minimize common failure modes and vulnerabilities within the communications infrastructure. For example, wireless networks (e.g., 3G, 4G) can be used to provide diverse and redundant delivery of data.",
