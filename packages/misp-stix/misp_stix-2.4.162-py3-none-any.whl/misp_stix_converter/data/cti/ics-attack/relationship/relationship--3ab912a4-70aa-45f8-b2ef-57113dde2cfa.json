            "description": "Do not inherently rely on the authenticity provided by the network/link layer (e.g., 802.11, LTE, 802.15.4), as link layer equipment may have long lifespans and protocol vulnerabilities may not be easily patched. Provide defense-in-depth by implementing authenticity within the associated application-layer protocol, or through a network-layer VPN. Furthermore, ensure communications schemes provide strong replay protection, employing techniques such as timestamps or cryptographic nonces.",
