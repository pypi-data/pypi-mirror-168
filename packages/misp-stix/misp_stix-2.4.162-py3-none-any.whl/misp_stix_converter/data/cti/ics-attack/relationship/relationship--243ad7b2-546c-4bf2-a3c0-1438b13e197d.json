            "description": "Automation protocols (e.g., OPC, DNP3) can restrict access to certain 'points'/requests based on a user's or device's privilege, this can prevent an unauthorized user from identifying certain point or tag identifiers. For example, DNP3-SA requires challenge-response authentication for certain DNP3 requests, similar techniques could be extended more broadly to other points or tags.\n\nSystems and devices should restrict access to any data with potential confidentiality concerns, including point and tag information.",
