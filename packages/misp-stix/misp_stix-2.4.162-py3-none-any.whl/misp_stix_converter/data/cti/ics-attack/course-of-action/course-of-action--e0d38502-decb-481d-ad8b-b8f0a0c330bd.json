Role-based Access Control (RBAC) schemes can help reduce the overhead of assigning permissions to the large number of devices within an ICS. For example, IEC 62351 provides examples of roles used to support common system operations within the electric power sector (Citation: IEC 62351), while IEEE 1686 provide sets of standard permissions for users of IEDs.
