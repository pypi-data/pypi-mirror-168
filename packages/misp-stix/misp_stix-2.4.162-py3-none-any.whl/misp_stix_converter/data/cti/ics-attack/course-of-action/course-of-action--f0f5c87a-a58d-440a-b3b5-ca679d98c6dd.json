Hot-standbys in diverse locations can ensure continued operations if the primarily system are compromised or unavailable. At the network layer, protocols such as the Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP, IEC 62439-3:2012-07) can be used to simulatenously use redundant and diverse communication over a local network.",
