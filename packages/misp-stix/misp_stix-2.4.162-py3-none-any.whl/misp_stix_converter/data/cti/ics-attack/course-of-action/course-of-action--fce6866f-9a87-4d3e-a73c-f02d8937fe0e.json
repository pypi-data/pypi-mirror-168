(Citation: CISA Mar 2010) To minimize this threat, organizations should implement measures to detect, understand, and reduce unnecessary RF propagation. (Citation: DHS National Urban Security Technology Laboratory Apr 2019) Techniques can include (i) reducing transmission power on wireless signals, (ii) adjust antenna gain to prevent extensions beyond organizational boundaries, and (iii) employ RF shielding techniques to block excessive signal propagation.",
