            "description": "Network sniffing is the practice of using a network interface on a computer system to monitor or capture information (Citation: EAttack Network Sniffing) regardless of whether it is the specified destination for the information.  \n\nAn adversary may attempt to sniff the traffic to gain information about the target.  This information can vary in the level of importance.  Relatively unimportant information is general communications to and from machines.  Relatively important information would be login information.  User credentials may be sent over an unencrypted protocol, such as [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc854 Telnet], that can be captured and obtained through network packet analysis. Network sniffing can be a way to discover information for <span class=\"smw-format list-format \"><span class=\"smw-row\"><span class=\"smw-field\"><span class=\"smw-value\">Control Device Identification</span></span></span></span>. \n\nIn addition, ARP and Domain Name Service (DNS) poisoning can be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.\n\nDetection: Detecting the events leading up to sniffing network traffic may be the best method of detection. From the host level, an adversary would likely need to perform a man-in-the-middle attack against other devices on a wired network in order to capture traffic that was not to or from the current compromised system. This change in the flow of information is detectable at the enclave network level. Monitor for ARP spoofing and gratuitous ARP broadcasts. Detecting compromised network devices is a bit more challenging. Auditing administrator logins, configuration changes, and device images is required to detect malicious changes.",
