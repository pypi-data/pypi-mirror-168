## [Ping Payments API]

The Ping Payments API is implemented as the `PaymentsApi` class contains a number of endpoints.

**Ping Payments API Endpoints**

- [Merchant]
- [Payment Orders]
- [Payment]
- [Payout]
- [Ping]

## [Ping Payment Links API]

The Ping Payments API is implemented as the `PaymentLinksApi` contains a number of endpoints.

**Ping Payment Links API Endpoints**

- [Payment Link]
- [Invoice]
- [Receipt]

## Usage

#### Get a tenant ID

Ping Payments provides you with a `tenant ID` and are used for resource permissions.

**Important:** Make sure you store and access the tenant ID securely.

#### Instructions

1. Import the PaymentsApi class from the Ping module:

```python
from ping.payments_api import PaymentsApi
```

2. Instantiate a PaymentsApi object and initialize it with the tenant ID and the environment that you want to use.

Initialize the PaymentsApi in production mode:

```python
payments_api = PaymentsApi(
		tenant_id = '55555555-5555-5555-5555-555555555555'
)
```

Initialize the PaymentsApi in sandbox mode, for testing:

```python
payments_api = PaymentsApi(
		tenant_id = '55555555-5555-5555-5555-555555555555',
		environment = 'sandbox'
)
```

#### Make calls

**Work with the API by by choosing a Endpoint and calling itÂ´s methods.** For example, you can choose the endpoint `merchants` and call the method `list()` to a list of all merchants connected to a tenant:

```python
result = payments_api.merchant.list()
```

#### Handle the response

Calls to the Ping Payments API endpoint methods returns an ApiResponse object. Properties of the ApiResponse object contains information regarding request _(headers and request)_ and the response _(status_code, reason_phrase, text, errors, body, and cursor)_.

**Using the response:**

Check whether the response succeeded or failed. Two helper methods `is_success()`and `is_error()` in the ApiResponse object determine the success or failure of a call:

```python
if result.is_success():
	# Display the successful response as text
	print(result.text)
elif result.is_error():
	# Display the error response
	print(f"Errors: {result.errors}")
```
