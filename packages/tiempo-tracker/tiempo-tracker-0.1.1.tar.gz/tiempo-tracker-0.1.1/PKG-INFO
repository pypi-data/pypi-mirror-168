Introduction
=========================
Track time you've spent on different tasks. Then see how much time you've spent on each. 

Continuation of `time_management <https://github.com/dmikhr/time_management>`_ script idea.


**Development**
=========================
Built with Python, Poetry, SQLAlchemy for managing database, SQLite as database. 

Testing: Pytest

Run package without building: ``poetry run python -m time_tracker [options]`` in the project directory

Example: ``poetry run python -m time_tracker -a Task1``

Run tests: ``poetry run pytest``


**Installation**
=========================
**From source**

run ``make build`` and then ``make package-install`` in the package directory.

**PIP**

run ``pip install tiempo-tracker``

When you run app for the first time it will create a database. You'll see a message:

``Database not found. Creating new one``

Also app will show path where database is stored.


**Usage**
=========================
tiempo-tracker can be invoked by ``trt`` command in the terminal.
Available options:
::

    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -s START, --start START
                            Start task by providing its name
    -f, --finish          Finish current task. Task also can be finished 
                            by starting a different task
    -a ADD, --add ADD     Add new task
    -r REMOVE, --remove REMOVE
                            Remove the task
    -l, --list            List of all tasks
    -st STATS, --stats STATS
                            Stats about tasks


Start with adding new task:

``trt -a task1``

Then track the task:

``trt -s task1``

To finish the task either start a new one (add new task first if it doesn't exist yet):

``trt -s task2``

or finish task

``trt -f``

Show all added tasks:

``trt -l``

If particular task is in progress there will be ``(in progress)`` status near this task. Example:
::

    Project_work
    Exercising (in progress)
    Flask_API_project
    Some_task

Remove task if it's no longer needed:

``trt -r task1``

See how much time you've spent on each task during the day:

``trt -st``

Time will be presented in two formats: ``hr:min`` and as a decimal number. The latter is convenient for further storage in spreadsheets.
